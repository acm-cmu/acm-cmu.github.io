Players could then transform robots to satisfy their needs as the game progressed to eventually terraform more tiles than their opponent by the end of the game. Algorithms had to control the varying metal resources, robot collisions, and costs to transform.' },

Students acted as internet service providers to establish cell towers across the impoverished and technologically desolate land of Ohhiyo (a fictional place). Players vied for power by building roads and cell towers near high populations as quickly as possible. Algorithms had to contend with terrain of varying building cost and clever opponents who might fence them in.' },
